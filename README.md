# Age Gate
by Connor Finnegan

Inspired by my [favorite local brewery[https://otherhalfbrewing.com/).


## Instructions

1. Clone locally using
 `git clone git@github.com:cfinn16/age-gate.git`
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Start your server using `npm start`
5. Navigate to app in [browser](http://localhost:3000)


## Technologies

To complete this project, I used React, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.


## Functionality

The age gate calculates back 21 years from the current month to determine if the user is of legal drinking age when they click the 'Enter' button. If they are, they are shown the welcome page. If they are not, they are shown the failure page. If the user checks 'Remember Me' before hitting Enter and is of legal drinking age, the next time they visit the site they will see the welcome page.
